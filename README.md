Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra, with applications spanning numerous fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, and more. They provide valuable insights into the behavior of linear transformations, matrices, and systems of equations.
It's important to note that a matrix may have multiple eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, and these eigenvalues may be real or complex numbers. Additionally, eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are linearly independent.
